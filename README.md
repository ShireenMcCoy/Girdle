# Girdle
A Wordle knockoff for people who like to suffer.

In Girdle, the secret word wraps clockwise in a circle.
The word can start at any point in the circle, but you must start entering letters from the top square.

Like in Wordle, you have 6 chances to guess the word. But unlike in wordle, you're allowed to enter non-valid words.
